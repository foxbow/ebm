EasyBookMarks is a collection of PHP scripts to have a centralized bookmark collection. It also offers some Javascript Bookmarklets to easily add bookmarks to the collection. All bookmark categories are also available in RSS format to use them in a browser that supports live bookmarks. 

## Firefox
Since Firefox does no longer support RSS based Live Bookmarks I recommend to install the 
[livemarks](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/livemarks/) plugin. This also allows to import the OPML file created by firefox.

## Chrome
Chrome does not support Live Bookmarks either. The foxish plugin worked around this issue but unfortunately became an agent that inserted ads into loaded pages. Even if this may no longer be the case, I stopped using it and relied on Firefox.

### Demo
an example installation is planned..
