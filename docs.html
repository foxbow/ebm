<h1>EasyBookMarks Documentation</h1>
<p>EasyBookMarks <i>ebm</i> is a little PHP scriptset that allows
you to collect and maintain Weblinks on a webpage. The main goal
was to have a list of bookmarks that were not attached to the
browser that's being used but were accessible anywhere, especially
after a fresh install.</p>

<p>Over the time a couple of features and changes made the simple
page what it has become now.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>


<h2>Installation</h2>
<h3>Installing the package</h3>
<p>Just unpack the archive somewhere in the subtree that can be
accessed by the webserver.</p>

<p><b>tar -zxpf ebm-<i>version</i>.tar.gz</b></p>

<p>Additionally you may need to set the user and group accordingly
so the webserver may access the files.</p>

<p>After this you need to create a <b>settings.php</b> file, just
copy the supplied <b>settings.ini</b> and edit it accordingly.
This file just contains the description of the database access 
and will not be overwritten upon updating.</p>

<h3>Maintenance</h3>
<p>After installing and opening the index page for the first time
you will get an error message complaining that a table could
not be read out. This message triggers the creation of the
needed tables and will not appear again.</p>

<p>With setting up the basic tables, the admin user called 
<b>ebm</b> will be created. You should now press the <i>Login</i>
link and log in as <b>ebm</b> with the password <b>ebm</b>.
After that the <i>Login</i> links will be replaced with an
<i>Admin</i> links. Following this you'll be transported to
the settings page where you can customize the features, create
new users, delete users and change passwords. You should first
change the password for <b>ebm</b>.</p>

<h3>The Admin Page</h3>
<p>Once you log in as user <b>ebm</b> you have access to the 
<i>Admin</i> page where you find the following options.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Title</b>
<br>This is the text that will be set as <i>&lt;title&gt;</i>
    tag for the page. It will also be the headline.
<li><b>Default category</b>
<br>The category that will be opened as default. If that
    category does not exist, no category will be opened.
<li><b>Add/edit without login</b>
<br>Allows anyone who visits the site to add and edit
    bookmarks on the page.
<li><b>Shortcut button</b>
<br>Shows a button labelled <b>P</b> after each entry which
    allows the logged in user to copy that link into his
    personal default category.
<li><b>Kill button</b>
<br>Shows a button after each entry which allows to delete
    the entry without needing to open the edit view.
<li><b>New window button</b>
<br>Shows a button that will open the link in a new browser
    window. In fact it uses the <i>target="_blank"</i> value.
<li><b>Contact address</b>
<br>The email address that will be shown in the footer. If
    this is left empty a default will be set.
<li><b>Force login</b>
<br>With this flag set, every user has to log in before seeing
    any page, even the public bookmarks.
<li><b>Show searchfields</b>
<br>The searchfields are two textfields, one serving as a
    shortcut to 
    <a href="http://dict.leo.org"><i>dict.leo.org</i></a>,
    a great online german/english translator and another
    shortcut to
    <a href="http://www.google.de"><i>google.de</i></a>.
</ul>

<h3>Update the package</h3>
<p>Just unpack the package over the old installation. If you did
not do any modifications beyond editing <b>settings.php</b>
you're done after resetting the user and group attributes.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>What about subcategories?
  <br>The current data model does not offer the background
    for subcategories. If Version 2 ever makes it into the 
    light it will have subcategories.
  <li>Will you support <i>database</i>?
  <br>Only if I get to play with it, else feel free to write
    your own interface. Look at the <b>db</b> directory to
    find a sceleton and the provided interfaces. It shouldn't
    be hard to create an own with that help.
  <li>The created HTML is not W3 conform!
  <br>Right, it isn't. Mainly because Microsoft's Internet
    Explorer can't handle proper HTML *D'Oh!* Nested forms
    and tables will look awful when programmed after the
    definitions.
  <li>Why do I need cookies?
  <br>The main reason is, that 
    <i><a href="http://">Dillo</a></i> 
    still does not know how to handle AUTH requests. Furthermore
    it's more handy to stay logged in for a month. If enough
    people bug me 'll add a switch that allows to change the 
    behaviour back to Apache's .htaccess style authentication.
